                    <p>She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene</p>
                    <p>I said don't mind, but what do you mean, I am the onw</p>
                    <p>Who will dance on the floor in the round?</p>
                    <p>She said I am the one, who will dance on the floor in the round</p>
                    <p>She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene</p>
                    <p>Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one</p>
                    <p>Who will dance on the floor in the round</p>
                    <p>People always told me be careful of what you do</p>
                    <p>And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts</p>
                    <p>And mother always told me be careful of who you love</p>
                    <p>And be careful of what you do 'cause the lie becomes the truth</p>
                    <p>Billie Jean is not my lover</p>
                    <p>She's just a girl who claims that I am the one</p>
                    <p>But the kid is not my son</p>
                    <p>She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son</p>
                    <p>For forty days and forty nights</p>
                    <p>The law was on her side</p>
                    <p>But who can stand when she's in demand</p>
                    <p>Her schemes and plans</p>
                    <p>'Cause we danced on the floor in the round</p>
                    <p>So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice</p>
                    <p>(Do think twice, do think twice)</p>
                    <p>She told my baby we'd danced 'til three, then she looked at me</p>
                    <p>Then showed a photo my baby cried his eyes were like mine (oh, no)</p>
                    <p>'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby</p>
                    <p>People always told me be careful of what you do</p>
                    <p>And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts</p>
                    <p>She came and stood right by me</p>
                    <p>Just the smell of sweet perfume</p>
                    <p>This happened much too soon</p>
                    <p>She called me to her room</p>
